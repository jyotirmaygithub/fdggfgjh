                                The main purpose of deforestation is to increase the land area. Also, this land area is
                                to set up new industries. And, this all is because of the increase in population. As the
                                population increases the demand for products also increase. So rich businessmen set up
                                these industries to increase profit. Also deforestation is cause due to some value wood
                                present in large numbers in the forest and natural disaster. </P>

                                loss of the trees cut down. Moreover, the use of plant-based products should
                                increase.This would force different industries to grow more trees. As a result, not only
                                environmental but living beings will also get benifit. At last the government should
